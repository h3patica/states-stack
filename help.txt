Tool for automatically assigning state ownership, claims, and cores on a large scale.
Reads states from ./states, then history/states, and lets you pull them onto the 'stack',
a list which contains every state you wish to perform actions on.

commands:   help	       Displays this information
	    examples	       Show command examples and their English equivalent
	    implementation     A technical breakdown of the program in some detail
	    pull ATTR	       Pulls certain states that have ATTR onto the stack
	    set [ATTR1] ATTR2  Sets all states that have ATTR1 on the stack to have ATTR2
			       If ATTR1 is ommitted, set all states on the stack to have ATTR2
	    clear [ATTR]       Clears the stack, deleting any changes made
			       (If ATTR is included, only clears states that have ATTR)
	    push	       Writes the states on the stack to ./states, and then clears the stack
	    exit	       Exits the program

attributes: id		       State ID
	    tag		       Tag of the owner of a state
	    core	       Tags of cores
	    claim	       Tags of claims

modifiers:  attr	       OR, pulls any state that meets attr to any degree,
			       adds to state's attributes when setting
	    &attr     	       AND, pulls any state that has at least all of attr,
			       has no effect when setting
	    @attr	       ONLY, pulls any state that has only attr,
			       replaces state's attribute with attr when setting
	    !attr	       NOT, pulls any state which doesn't have attr
			       removes attr from state when setting
